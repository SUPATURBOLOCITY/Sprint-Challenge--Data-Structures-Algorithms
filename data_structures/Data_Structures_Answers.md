Add your answers to the questions below.

What is the runtime complexity of your depth_first_for_each method?

Linear or O(n)

What is the space complexity of your depth_first_for_each function?

O(h) where h is the max height of the tree

What is the runtime complexity of your breadth_first_for_each method?

Linear

What is the space complexity of your breadth_first_for_each method?

O(w) where w is the max width of the tree

What is the runtime complexity of your heapsort function?

O(nlog(n))

What is the space complexity of the heapsort function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

O(n)

O(1)
